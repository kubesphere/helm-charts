# values-minikube.yaml
# This example intended as baseline to use Minikube for the deployment of GitLab
# - Minimized CPU/Memory load, can fit into 2 CPU, 4 GB of RAM (barely)
# - Services that are not compatible with how Minikube runs are disabled
# - Some services entirely removed, or scaled down to 1 replica.
# - Configured to use 192.168.99.100, and nip.io for the domain

# Minimal settings
