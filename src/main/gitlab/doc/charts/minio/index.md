# Using Minio for Object storage

This chart is based on [`stable/minio`](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio)
version [`0.4.3`](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/aaaf98b5d25c26cc2d483925f7256f2ce06be080/stable/minio),
and inherits most settings from there.

## Design Choices

Design choices related to the [upstream chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio)
can be found in the project's README.

GitLab chose to alter that chart in order to simplify configuration of the secrets,
and to remove all use of secrets in environment variables. GitLab added `initContainer`s
to control the population of secrets into the `config.json`, and a chart-wide `enabled` flag.

This chart makes use of only one secret:

- `global.minio.credentials.secret`: A global secret containing the `accesskey` and
  `secretkey` values that will be used for authentication to the bucket(s).

## Configuration

We will describe all the major sections of the configuration below. When configuring
from the parent chart, these values will be:

```
minio:
  init:
  ingress:
    enabled:
    tls:
      enabled:
      secretName:
    annotations:
    proxyReadTimeout:
    proxyBodySize:
    proxyBuffering:
  tolerations:
  persistence: (upstream)
    volumeName:
    matchLabels:
    matchExpressions:
  serviceType: (upstream)
  servicePort: (upstream)
  defaultBuckets:
  minioConfig: (upstream)
```

## Chart configuration examples

### pullSecrets

`pullSecrets` allows you to authenticate to a private registry to pull images for a pod.

Additional details about private registries and their authentication methods can be
found in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).

Below is an example use of `pullSecrets`:

```YAML
image: my.minio.repository
imageTag: latest
imagePullPolicy: Always
pullSecrets:
- name: my-secret-name
- name: my-secondary-secret-name
```

### tolerations

`tolerations` allow you schedule pods on tainted worker nodes

Below is an example use of `tolerations`:

```YAML
tolerations:
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoExecute"
```

## Enable the sub-chart

They way we've chosen to implement compartmentalized sub-charts includes the ability
to disable the components that you may not want in a given deployment. For this reason,
the first setting you should decide on is `enabled:`.

By default, Minio is enabled out of the box, but is not recommended for production use.
When you are ready to disable it, run `--set global.minio.enabled: false`.

## Configure the initContainer

While rarely altered, the `initContainer` behaviors can be changed via the following items:

```
init:
  image: busybox
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  script:
```

### initContainer image

The initContainer image settings are just as with a normal image configuration, the
defaults are listed above.

### initContainer script

The initContainer is passed the following items:

- The secret containing authentication items mounted in `/config`, usually `accesskey`
  and `secretkey`.
- The ConfigMap containing the `config.json` template, and `configure` containing a
  script to be executed with `sh`, mounted in `/config`.
- An `emptyDir` mounted at `/minio` that will be passed to the daemon's container.

The initContainer is expected to populate `/minio/config.json` with a completed configuration,
using `/config/configure` script. When the `minio-config` container has completed
that task, the `/minio` directory will be passed to the `minio` container, and used
to provide the `config.json` to the [minio](https://min.io) server.

## Configuring the Ingress

These settings control the minio ingress.

| Name             | Type    | Default | Description |
|:---------------- |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `annotations`    | String  |         | This field is an exact match to the standard `annotations` for [Kubernetes Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). |
| `enabled`        | Boolean | `false` | Setting that controls whether to create ingress objects for services that support them. When `false` the `global.ingress.enabled` setting is used. |
| `tls.enabled`    | Boolean | `true`  | When set to `false`, you disable TLS for Minio. This is mainly useful when you cannot use TLS termination at ingress-level, like when you have a TLS-terminating proxy before the ingress controller. |
| `tls.secretName` | String  |         | The name of the Kubernetes TLS Secret that contains a valid certificate and key for the minio url. When not set, the `global.ingress.tls.secretName` is used instead. |

## Configuring the image

The `image`, `imageTag` and `imagePullPolicy` defaults are
[documented upstream](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio#configuration).

## Persistence

This chart provisions a `PersistentVolumeClaim` and mounts a corresponding persistent
volume to default location `/export`. You'll need physical storage available in the
Kubernetes cluster for this to work. If you'd rather use `emptyDir`, disable `PersistentVolumeClaim`
by: `persistence.enabled: false`.

The behaviors for [`persistence`](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio#persistence)
are [documented upstream](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio#configuration).

GitLab has added a few items:

```
persistence:
  volumeName:
  matchLabels:
  matchExpressions:
```

| Name               | Type    | Default | Description |
|:------------------ |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `volumeName`       | String  | `false` | When `volumeName` is provided, the `PersistentVolumeClaim` will use the provided `PersistentVolume` by name, in place of creating a `PersistentVolume` dynamically. This overrides the upstream behavior. |
| `matchLabels`      | Map     | `true`  | Accepts a Map of label names and label values to match against when choosing a volume to bind. This is used in the `PersistentVolumeClaim` `selector` section. See the [volumes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#selector). |
| `matchExpressions` | Array   |         | Accepts an array of label condition objects to match against when choosing a volume to bind. This is used in the `PersistentVolumeClaim` `selector` section. See the [volumes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#selector). |

## defaultBuckets

`defaultBuckets` provides a mechanism to automatically create buckets on the Minio
pod at *installation*. This property contains an array of items, each with up to three
properties: `name`, `policy`, and `purge`.

```
defaultBuckets:
  - name: public
    policy: public
    purge: true
  - name: private
  - name: public-read
    policy: download
```

| Name     | Type    | Default | Description |
|:-------- |:-------:|:--------|:------------|
| `name`   | String  |         | The name of the bucket that is created. The provided value should conform to [AWS bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html), meaning that it should be compliant with DNS and contain only the characters a-z, 0-9, and – (hyphen) in strings between 3 and 63 characters in length. The `name` property is _required_ for all entries. |
| `policy` |         | `none`  | The value of `policy` controls the access policy of the bucket on Minio. The `policy` property is not required, and the default value is `none`. In regards to **anonymous** access, possible values are: `none` (no anonymous access), `download` (anonymous read-only access), `upload` (anonymous write-only access) or `public` (anonymous read/write access). |
| `purge`  | Boolean |         | The `purge` property is provided as a means to cause any existing bucket to be removed with force, at installation time. This only comes into play when using a pre-existing `PersistentVolume` for the volumeName property of [persistence](#persistence). If you make use of a dynamically created `PersistentVolume`, this will have no valuable effect as it only happens at chart installation and there will be no data in the `PersistentVolume` that was just created. This property is not required, but you may specify this property with a value of `true` in order to cause a bucket to purged with force `mc rm -r --force`. |

## Security Context

These options allow control over which `user` and/or `group` is used to start the pod.

For in-depth information about security context, please refer to the official
[Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/).

## Service Type and Port

These are [documented upstream](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio#configuration),
and the key summary is:

```
## Expose the Minio service to be accessed from outside the cluster (LoadBalancer service).
## or access it from within the cluster (ClusterIP service). Set the service type and the port to serve it.
## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/
##
serviceType: LoadBalancer
servicePort: 9000
```

The chart does not expect to be of the `type: NodePort`, so **do not** set it as such.

## Upstream items

The [upstream documentation](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/minio)
for the following also applies completely to this chart:

- `resources`
- `nodeSelector`
- `minioConfig`

Further explanation of the `minioConfig` settings can be found in the
[minio notify documentation](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-bucket-notification-guide).
This includes details on publishing notifications when Bucket Objects are accessed or changed.
