# Using the GitLab Unicorn Chart

The `unicorn` sub-chart provides the GitLab Rails webserver with two Unicorn workers
per pod. (The minimum necessary for a single pod to be able to serve any web request in GitLab)

Currently the container used in the chart also includes a copy of GitLab Workhorse,
which we haven't split out yet.

## Requirements

This chart depends on Redis, PostgreSQL, Gitaly, and Registry services, either as
part of the complete GitLab chart or provided as external services reachable from
the Kubernetes cluster this chart is deployed onto.

## Configuration

The `unicorn` chart is configured as follows: [Global Settings](#global-settings),
[Ingress Settings](#ingress-settings), [External Services](#external-services), and
[Chart Settings](#chart-settings).

## Installation command line options

The table below contains all the possible chart configurations that can be supplied
to the `helm install` command using the `--set` flags.

## Chart configuration examples

### image.pullSecrets

`pullSecrets` allows you to authenticate to a private registry to pull images for a pod.

Additional details about private registries and their authentication methods can be
found in [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod).

Below is an example use of `pullSecrets`:

```yaml
image:
  repository: my.unicorn.repository
  pullPolicy: Always
  pullSecrets:
  - name: my-secret-name
  - name: my-secondary-secret-name
```

### tolerations

`tolerations` allow you schedule pods on tainted worker nodes

Below is an example use of `tolerations`:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
- key: "node_label"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "true"
  effect: "NoExecute"
```

### annotations

`annotations` allows you to add annotations to the Unicorn pods. For example:

```yaml
annotations:
  kubernetes.io/example-annotation: annotation-value
```

## Using the Community Edition of this chart

By default, the Helm charts use the Enterprise Edition of GitLab. If desired, you
can use the Community Edition instead. Learn more about the
[differences between the two](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/).

In order to use the Community Edition, set `image.repository` to
`registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-webservice-ce` and `workhorse.image`
to `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/build/cng/gitlab-workhorse-ce`.

## Global Settings

We share some common global settings among our charts. See the [Globals Documentation](../../globals.md)
for common configuration options, such as GitLab and Registry hostnames.

## Ingress Settings

| Name                                   | Type    | Default | Description |
|:-------------------------------------- |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `ingress.annotations.*annotation-key*` | String  | (empty) | `annotation-key` is a string that will be used with the value as an annotation on every Ingress. For example: `ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/enable-access-log"=true`. |
| `ingress.enabled`                      | Boolean | `false` | Setting that controls whether to create Ingress objects for services that support them. When `false`, the `global.ingress.enabled` setting value is used. |
| `ingress.proxyBodySize`                | String  | `512m`  | [See Below](#proxyBodySize). |
| `ingress.tls.enabled`                  | Boolean | `true`  | When set to `false`, you disable TLS for GitLab Unicorn. This is mainly useful for cases in which you cannot use TLS termination at Ingress-level, like when you have a TLS-terminating proxy before the Ingress Controller. |
| `ingress.tls.secretName`               | String  | (empty) | The name of the Kubernetes TLS Secret that contains a valid certificate and key for the GitLab url. When not set, the `global.ingress.tls.secretName` value is used instead. |

### proxyBodySize

`proxyBodySize` is used to set the NGINX proxy maximum body size. This is commonly
required to allow a larger docker image than the default. As an alternative option,
you can set the body size with either of the following two parameters too:

- `gitlab.unicorn.ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/proxy-body-size"`
- `global.ingress.annotations."nginx\.ingress\.kubernetes\.io/proxy-body-size"`

## Resources

### Unicorn Worker Killer memory settings

Memory thresholds for the [unicorn-worker-killer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/unicorn.html#unicorn-worker-killer)
can be customized using the `memory.min` and `memory.max` chart values. While the
default values are sane, you can increase (or lower) these values to fine-tune
them for your environment or troubleshoot performance issues.

NOTE: **Note:** These settings are effective on a _per process basis_, not for an entire Pod.

### Memory requests/limits

Each pod spawns an amount of workers equal to `workerProcesses`, who each use
some baseline amount of memory. The default memory requests and limits are based
on two workers at the [measured usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/3853)
of 750MB /worker, and a maximum usage of about 1G /worker. Thus, if you update
`workerProcesses`, you should update `requests.memory` and `limits.memory`
(if configured) accordingly. Note though, that as GitLab and usage changes, the
required resources will change as well.

Default:

```yaml
workerProcesses: 2
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 1.5G # = 2 * 750M
# limits:
#   memory: 2G   # = 2 * 1G
```

With 4 workers configured:

```yaml
workerProcesses: 4
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 3G   # = 4 * 750M
# limits:
#   memory: 4G   # = 4 * 1G
```

## External Services

### Redis

```yaml
redis:
  host: redis.example.com
  serviceName: redis
  port: 6379
  sentinels:
    - host: sentinel1.example.com
      port: 26379
  password:
    enabled: true
    secret: gitlab-redis
    key: redis-password
```

| Name               | Type    | Default | Description |
|:------------------ |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `host`             | String  |         | The hostname of the Redis server with the database to use. This can be omitted in lieu of `serviceName`. If using Redis Sentinels, the `host` attribute needs to be set to the cluster name as specified in the `sentinel.conf`.|
| `serviceName`      | String  | `redis` | The name of the `service` which is operating the Redis database. If this is present, and `host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `host` value. This is convenient when using Redis as a part of the overall GitLab chart. |
| `port`             | Integer | `6379`  | The port on which to connect to the Redis server. |
| `password.key`     | String  |         | The `password.key` attribute for Redis defines the name of the key in the secret (below) that contains the password. |
| `password.secret`  | String  |         | The `password.secret` attribute for Redis defines the name of the Kubernetes `Secret` to pull from. |
| `password.enabled` | Bool    | true    | The `password.enabled` provides a toggle for using a password with the Redis instance. |
| `sentinels.[].host`| String  |         | The hostname of Redis Sentinel server for a Redis HA setup. |
| `sentinels.[].port`| Integer | `26379` | The port on which to connect to the Redis Sentinel server. |

_Note:_ The current Redis Sentinel support only supports Sentinels that have
been deployed separately from the GitLab chart. As a result, the Redis
deployment through the GitLab chart should be disabled with `redis.install=false`.
The Secret containing the Redis password will need to be manually created
before deploying the GitLab chart.

### PostgreSQL

```YAML
psql:
  host: psql.example.com
  serviceName: pgbouncer
  port: 5432
  database: gitlabhq_production
  username: gitlab
  preparedStatements: false

| `host`            | String  |                       | The hostname of the PostgreSQL server with the database to use. This can be omitted if `postgresql.install=true` (default non-production). |
| `serviceName`     | String  |                       | The name of the `service` which is operating the PostgreSQL database. If this is present, and `host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service in place of the `host` value. |
| `database`        | String  | `gitlabhq_production` | The name of the database to use on the PostgreSQL server. |
| `password.key`    | String  |                       | The `password.key` attribute for PostgreSQL defines the name of the key in the secret (below) that contains the password. |
| `password.secret` | String  |                       | The `password.secret` attribute for PostgreSQL defines the name of the Kubernetes `Secret` to pull from. |
| `pool`            | Integer | `10`                  | How many connections are made to the database. |
| `port`            | Integer | `5432`                | The port on which to connect to the PostgreSQL server. |
| `username`        | String  | `gitlab`              | The username with which to authenticate to the database. |
| `preparedStatements`| Bool  | `false`               | If prepared statements should be used when communicating with the PostgreSQL server. |

  tokenIssuer: gitlab-issuer
  certificate:
    secret: gitlab-registry
    key: registry-auth.key
```

| Name                 | Type    | Default         | Description |
|:-------------------- |:-------:|:--------------- |:----------- |
| `api.host`           | String  |                 | The hostname of the Registry server to use. This can be omitted in lieu of `api.serviceName`. |
| `api.port`           | Integer | `5000`          | The port on which to connect to the Registry API. |
| `api.protocol`       | String  |                 | The protocol Unicorn should use to reach the Registry API. |
| `api.serviceName`    | String  | `registry`      | The name of the `service` which is operating the Registry server. If this is present, and `api.host` is not, the chart will template the hostname of the service (and current `.Release.Name`) in place of the `api.host` value. This is convenient when using Registry as a part of the overall GitLab chart. |
| `certificate.key`    | String  |                 | The name of the `key` in the `Secret` which houses the certificate bundle that will be provided to the [registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry/) container as `auth.token.rootcertbundle`. |
| `certificate.secret` | String  |                 | The name of the [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) that houses the certificate bundle to be used to verify the tokens created by the GitLab instance(s). |
| `host`               | String  |                 | The external hostname to use for providing docker commands to users in the GitLab UI. Falls back to the value set in the `registry.hostname` template. Which determines the registry hostname based on the values set in `global.hosts`. See the [Globals Documentation](../../globals.md) for more information. |
| `port`               | Integer |                 | The external port used in the hostname. Using port `80` or `443` will result in the URLs being formed with `http`/`https`. Other ports will all use `http` and append the port to the end of hostname, for example `http://registry.example.com:8443`. |
| `tokenIssuer`        | String  | `gitlab-issuer` | The name of the auth token issuer. This must match the name used in the Registry's configuration, as it incorporated into the token when it is sent. The default of `gitlab-issuer` is the same default we use in the Registry chart. |

## Chart Settings

The following values are used to configure the Unicorn Pods.

| Name              | Type    | Default | Description |
|:----------------- |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `replicaCount`    | Integer | `1`     | The number of Unicorn instances to create in the deployment. |
| `workerProcesses` | Integer | `2`     | The number of Unicorn workers to run per pod. You must have at least `2` workers available in your cluster in order for GitLab to function properly. Note that increasing the `workerProcesses` will increase the memory required by approximately `400MB` per worker, so you should update the pod `resources` accordingly. |

### metrics.enabled

By default, each pod exposes a metrics endpoint at `/-/metrics`. Metrics are only
available when [GitLab Prometheus metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html)
are enabled in the Admin area. When metrics are enabled, annotations are added to
each pod allowing a Prometheus server to discover and scrape the exposed metrics.

### GitLab Shell

GitLab Shell uses an Auth Token in its communication with Unicorn. Share the token
with GitLab Shell and Unicorn using a shared Secret.

```yaml
shell:
  authToken:
    secret: gitlab-shell-secret
    key: secret
  port:
```

| Name               | Type    | Default | Description |
|:------------------ |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `authToken.key`    | String  |         | Defines the name of the key in the secret (below) that contains the authToken. |
| `authToken.secret` | String  |         | Defines the name of the Kubernetes `Secret` to pull from. |
| `port`             | Integer | `22`    | The port number to use in the generation of SSH URLs within the GitLab UI. Controlled by `global.shell.port`. |

### WebServer options

Current version of chart supports both Unicorn and Puma web servers.
Unicorn is the default, however you can switch to the experimental
Puma server by setting `webServer: puma`

Puma unique options:

| Name               | Type    | Default | Description |
|:------------------ |:-------:|:------- |:----------- |
| `puma.workerMaxMemory`           | Integer | `1024`                | The maximum memory (in megabytes) for the Puma worker killer |
| `puma.threads.min`               | Integer | `4`                   | The minimum amount of Puma threads |
| `puma.threads.max`               | Integer | `4`                   | The maximum amount of Puma threads |
