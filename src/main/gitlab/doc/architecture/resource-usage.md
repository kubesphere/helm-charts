# Resource usage

## Resource Requests

All of our containers include predefined resource request values. By default we
have not put resource limits into place. But we recommend users set limits, particularly
on memory if they are running on nodes without a lot of excess memory capacity.
(You want to avoid running out of memory on any of your Kubernetes nodes, as the
Kernel memory killer may end essential Kube processes)

In order to come up with our default request values, we run the application, and
come up with a way to generate various levels of load for each service. We monitor the
service, and make a call on what we think is the best default value.

We will measure:

- **Idle Load** - No default should be below these values, but an idle process
  isn't useful, so typically we will not set a default based on this value.

- **Minimal Load** - The values required to do the most basic useful amount of work.
  Typically, for cpu, this will be used as the default, but memory requests come with
  the risk of the Kernel reaping processes, so we will avoid using this as a memory default.

- **Average Loads** - What is considered *average* is highly dependent on the installation,
  for our defaults we will attempt to take a few measurements at a few of what we
  consider reasonable loads. (we will list the loads used). If the service has a pod
  autoscaler, we will typically try to set the scaling target value based on these.
  And also the default memory requests.

- **Stressful Task** - Measure the usage of the most stressful task the service
  should perform. (Not necessary under load). When applying resource limits, try and
  set the limit above this and the average load values.

- **Heavy Load** - Try and come up with a stress test for the service, then measure
  the resource usage required to do it. We currently don't use these values for any
  defaults, but users will likely want to set resource limits somewhere between the
  average loads/stress task and this value.

### Webservice

Load was tested using <https://gitlab.com/andrewn/gitlab-load-kit> each test over
a period of 5 minutes, on the first 100 urls crawlable by the root user. Values
are per pod.

- **Idle values**
  - 0 concurrent user, 2 pods
    - cpu: 0
    - memory: 850M

- **Minimal Load**
  - 1 concurrent user, 2 pods
    - cpu: 300m
    - memory: 1.2G

- **Average Loads**
  - 5 concurrent users, 3 pods
    - cpu: 1
    - memory: 1.2G
  - 20 concurrent users, 3 pods
    - cpu: 1.4
    - memory: 1.2G

- **Stressful Task**
  - Loading large MR diff (`gitlab-ce master` to `10-0-stable`)
    - cpu: 400m
    - memory: 1.4G

- **Heavy Load**
  - 100 concurrent users, 5 pods
    - cpu: 1.5
    - memory: 1.2G

- **Default Requests**
  - cpu: 300m (from minimal load)
  - memory: 1.2G (from average loads)
  - target cpu average: 1 (from average loads)

- **Recommended Limits**
  - cpu: > 1.4 (greater than average load)
  - memory: > 1.4G (greater than stress task)

### Sidekiq

Load was tested using <https://gitlab.com/andrewn/gitlab-load-kit> and a custom executor that targeted the pipeline trigger API on a single project. This API was hit with 20 requests concurrently for varying amounts of time.

- **Idle values**
  - 0 tasks, 1 pods
    - cpu: 0
    - memory: 450M

- **Minimal Load**
  - ~20 tasks (create a single pipeline once), 1 pods
    - cpu: 50m
    - memory: 625M

- **Average Loads**
  - ~7 trigger pipelines/second for 1min, 2 pods
    - cpu: 310m
    - memory: 640M
  - ~7 trigger pipelines/second for 5min, 4 pods
    - cpu: 360m
    - memory 650M

- **Stressful Task**
  - Export the linux kernel as GitLab project
    - cpu: 1
    - memory: 840M

- **Heavy Load**
  - ~6 trigger pipelines/second for 20min, 10 pods
    - cpu: 920m
    - memory: 710M

- **Default Requests**
  - cpu: 50m (from minimal load)
  - memory: 650M (from average load)
  - target cpu average: 350m (from average loads)
    - *In the future [we should be using custom metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/1008) that measure the number of busy workers.*

- **Recommended Limits**
  - cpu: > 1 (greater than stress task)
  - memory: > 840M (greater than stress task)

### GitLab Shell

Load was tested using a bash loop calling  `nohup git clone <project> <random-path-name>` in order to have some concurrency.
In future tests we will try to include sustained concurrent load, to better match the types of tests we have done for the other services.

- **Idle values**
  - 0 tasks, 2 pods
    - cpu: 0
    - memory: 5M

- **Minimal Load**
  - 1 tasks (one empty clone), 2 pods
    - cpu: 0
    - memory: 5M

- **Average Loads**
  - 5 concurrent clones, 2 pods
    - cpu: 0.1
    - memory: 5M
  - 20 concurrent clones, 2 pods
    - cpu: 0.08
    - memory: 6M

- **Stressful Task**
  - SSH clone the linux kernel (17MB/s)
    - cpu: 0.28
    - memory: 17M
  - SSH push the linux kernel (2MB/s)
    - cpu: 0.14
    - memory: 13M
    - *Upload connection speed was likely a factor during our tests*

- **Heavy Load**
  - 100 concurrent clones, 4 pods
    - cpu: 0.11
    - memory: 7M

- **Default Requests**
  - cpu: 0 (from minimal load)
  - memory: 6M (from average load)
  - target cpu average: 0.1 (from average loads)

- **Recommended Limits**
  - cpu: > 0.3 (greater than stress task)
  - memory: > 20M (greater than stress task)
